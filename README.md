Game attempt inspired by Universal Paperclips.

The original Universal Paperclip game is created and copyrighted by Frank
Lantz. See [his website][fl] or the [web game][flup] itself.

The code contained here is not inspired or based on Frank Lantz code - mainly
due to the unknown licensing of its HTML and Javascript source code.

Frank Lantz's amazing game was taken as an inspiration to free my thoughts from
the game design and focus on the implementation of different game mechanics.
